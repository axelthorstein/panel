# panel

An interactive experience that lets users contribute to the visuals at an event. 
Panl is a cross-platform web app that lets anyone contribute from any device, and 
see themselves and their friends show up on the big screen.

# What it does
Panl uses WebRTC to capture a 3 second animated selfie from which it is 
pushed to event's Panl in real time, leveraging Firebase. 
Brands can set up a Panl at an event and create user engagement 
but also capture demographic from the crowd using our real-time data analytics dashboard. 
The demographic data is sourced from a still frame from the user's selfie, from which 
IBM Watson image recognition pulls demographic data. The Panl design also changes 
dynamically based on this demographic.
